 * The Http2ServerDowngrader currently is always incorrectly setting the "x-http2-stream-id"
 * header to "0", which is confusing. And as we don't actually need it and the other "x-http2-" headers, we
 * strip them out here to avoid the confusion.
 *
 * Hopefully in a future netty release that header value will be correct and we can then
 * stop doing this. Although potentially we _never_ want to pass these downstream to origins .... ?
