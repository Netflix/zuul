### The following uses UTF8 instead of Integer because "where revision=1" stops working after a period of time. See email thread "Help on Column Family Definition to Support Integer Where Query"

### to update metadata, it's done like this

update column family zuul_filters with  comparator=UTF8Type and column_metadata=[
   		{column_name: filter_id, validation_class: UTF8Type, index_type: KEYS},
   		{column_name: filter_name, validation_class: UTF8Type, index_type: 0},
   		{column_name: filter_type, validation_class: UTF8Type, index_type: 0},
   		{column_name: revision, validation_class: LongType, index_type: KEYS},
   		{column_name: active, validation_class: BooleanType, index_type: KEYS},
   		{column_name: canary, validation_class: BooleanType, index_type: 0},
   		{column_name: creation_date, validation_class: DateType, index_type: 0}
   		{column_name: application_name, validation_class: UTF8Type, index_type: KEYS}
   ];


update column family zuul_filters with column_metadata=[
	   {column_name: application_name, validation_class: UTF8Type, index_type: 0}];
